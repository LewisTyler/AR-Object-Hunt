# \# AR Object Hunt â€“ Unity AR Foundation Prototype

# 

# This is a Unity-based mobile AR prototype designed to demonstrate spatial gameplay, collectible object interactions, and a backend-ready architecture. It serves as a technical demo for an AR developer role and lays the groundwork for integration with AWS (API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB).

# 

# \## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

# 

# \- âœ… Demonstrate real-world AR interactions via AR Foundation

# \- âœ… Enable spatial gameplay using plane detection and object placement

# \- âœ… Implement a collectible mechanic with session tracking

# \- âœ… Decouple data logic to support later AWS integration

# \- âœ… Use clean and scalable Unity architecture

# \- âœ… Build-ready for Android (iOS optional)
